title: 'Credits'
---

The site is built with help of great open source instruments and the non-less incredible cloud services. I can't be grateful enough people behind each of them. Thanks a lot for sharing.

The site is powered by static-site engine [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with help of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and multiple [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/).

The code is written in [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) on [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), checked with [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

[Github](https://github.com) holds my [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository and runs my pipelines to build and publish the site on the most geekiest hosting I know - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). And, of course, nowhere to go without [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/). Its S3 keeps and serves my files reliably.

Thanks to
- [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) for code highlighting
- [@colemis](https://twitter.com/colebemis) for neat and open-sourced [icons](https://twitter.com/colebemis).
- JetBrains for their [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
- [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) for making the web-fonts for me.

And many more thanks awaits to come.
